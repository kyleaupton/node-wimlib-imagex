## About Wimlib

Wimlib is a C library for creating, modifying, extracting, and mounting files in the Windows Imaging Format (WIM files). For more information, visit the [wimlib website](https://wimlib.net/).

## Motivation

This package was conceived out of a necessity encountered during the development of [boot-builder](https://github.com/kyleaupton/boot-builder). The need for a Node.js interface to the `split` API of the wimlib C library became apparent, leading to the creation of Node Wimlib Split. This package aims to bridge that gap and provide a seamless integration of wimlib's capabilities into Node.js projects.
